# ADC
  As said earlier ADC stands for Analog to digital conversion and it is used to convert analog values from real world into digital values like 1’s and 0’s. These are the ones that we see in our day to day life like temperature, speed, brightness etc.
# AMPLIFIER
  An amplifier is an electronic device that increases the voltage, current, or power of a signal. Amplifiers are used in wireless communications and broadcasting, and in audio equipment of all kinds.
# TEMPERATURE SENSOR
  A temperature sensor is a device used to measure temperature. This can be air temperature, liquid temperature or the temperature of solid matter.
# TRIAC
  A TRIAC is a three terminal electronic component that conducts current in either direction when triggered. The term TRIAC is a genericised trademark. TRIACs are a subset of thyristors and are related to silicon controlled rectifiers.
# LCD
  A liquid-crystal display is a flat-panel display or other electronically modified optical device that uses liquid crystals and polarizers to manipulate light. Liquid crystals do not directly emit light, instead relying on a backlight or reflector to create colour or monochrome images.
# microcontroller
  A microcontroller is a small and low-cost microcomputer, which is designed to perform the specific tasks of embedded systems like displaying microwave’s information, receiving remote signals, etc.
